Architecture Overview:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63820c6e-e45b-481c-a220-4ba5d18c2b37)

The architecture comprises the following components:
1. Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR): A fully managed Docker container registry that stores your application images securely.
2. Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate: A serverless compute engine for containers that runs your application without managing servers.
3. Application Load Balancer (ALB): Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, enhancing availability and reliability.
4. Auto Scaling: Automatically adjusts the number of ECS tasks based on CPU or memory usage to handle varying traffic loads.
5. Terraform: An open-source IaC tool that provisions and manages AWS resources declaratively.

Here are the step-by-step details to set up an end-to-end Jenkins pipeline for a Java application using Maven, Sonarqube, Docker, ECR and ECS:

Prerequisites:
 - Java Application Code: Ensure your Java application's source code is hosted in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
 - Jenkins Server: Have a running Jenkins server with access to your Git repository.
 - AWS ECR Repository: Create an ECR repository to store your Docker images.
 - Terraform Code: Prepare Terraform scripts to set up the ECS cluster and related infrastructure.

Steps:

    1.  Set Up ECS Cluster with Terraform:
        Define resources such as ECS Cluster, Task Definitions, Services, and Load Balancers.
        Navigate to your Terraform directory and run:
        terraform init
        terraform apply
        This will set up the ECS cluster and related resources.
    
    2. Install the necessary Jenkins plugins:
       1.1 GitHub Integration Plugin: Facilitates Jenkins' interaction with GitHub repositories.
       1.2 Maven Integration Plugin: Enables Jenkins to build projects using Maven.
       1.3 SonarQube Scanner Plugin: Integrates SonarQube code quality analysis into Jenkins.
       1.4 Pipeline Plugin: Allows defining jobs using code, providing greater flexibility.
       1.5 Docker Pipeline Plugin.

    3. Create a new Jenkins pipeline:
       2.1 In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job and configure it with the GitHub repository URL for the Java application.
       2.2 Add a Jenkinsfile to the GitHub repository to define the pipeline stages.

    4. Define the pipeline stages:
        Stage 1: CheckOut the source code from GitHub.
        Stage 2: Build the Java application using Maven(Package the application into a JAR file).
        Stage 3: Run SonarQube analysis to check the code quality.
        Stage 4: Build and Tag Docker Image, then push to AWS ECR.
        Stage 6: Deploy the application to ECS.

    5. Run the Jenkins pipeline:
       5.1 Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to start the CI/CD process for the Java application.
       5.2 Monitor the pipeline stages and fix any issues that arise.

This end-to-end Jenkins pipeline will automate the entire CI/CD process for a Java application, from code checkout to production deployment, using popular tools like Maven, Sonarqube, Docker, ECR and ECS.
